### A hangman strategy simulation in Python.

**Description**

What's the best way to win a game of hangman? We simulate a few different strategies to see.

**Dependencies**

To produce the demo notebook `gallows.ipynb`, I used a word list from [Eric Price](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ecprice/) at MIT, which is available [here](http://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000). 

Of course, you can use any word list you would like, and the solution to a given game does not have to be a word within the corpus used to train a `Strategy`.
